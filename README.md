# Neural Network from Scratch

- This repository contains an implementation of a basic **Neural Network** built from scratch, without using high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- This is highly motivated by the Intro to Deep Learning course by Coursera. 
- The goal is to demonstrate how a neural network works at its core, with all the mathematical concepts and algorithms implemented manually in Python and Numpy.
